I encountered an Oracle credential error today (Friday) around 5 p.m. and could not connect due to my computer configuration. 
Due to that, I had to change to a local database and still encountered errors because I had to modify my whole application in a short time.
I also wasnâ€™t able to deploy to Google Cloud. 

However, you can see my commits, see the changes I've made, and see if the most recent update runs on your computer.
I apologize for the issues and the inconvenience.
